                    I am a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in building scalable,
                    high-quality applications. Currently pursuing my Master's in Web Engineering at Chemnitz
                    University of Technology, I continuously expand my expertise in modern technologies and
                    development methodologies. My background includes experience as a Software Engineer at Tech
                    Mahindra, where I contributed to the design, development, and optimization of features using
                    Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, JavaScript, and CMS platforms. I thrive on solving complex
                    challenges and delivering seamless user experiences, with a focus on both technical excellence
                    and user-centric design. As a lifelong learner, I'm always seeking new opportunities to enhance
                    my skills and collaborate on exciting projects. Please feel free to connect with me and send a
                    message.
